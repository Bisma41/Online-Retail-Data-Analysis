# Online Retail Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes transactional data from an online retail store spanning 2010â€“2011. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract actionable insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns to ensure data integrity.  
- **EDA and Visualization**: Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize sales patterns.  
- **Insights**: Identified peak sales on Thursdays, UK market dominance, and top-selling products.  

## Business Impact  
The analysis provides recommendations to optimize marketing strategies, manage inventory efficiently, and target key customer segments to enhance overall business performance.

- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier.  
- `Country`: Country where the transaction occurred.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Steps Taken
